## TODO

- [ ] Create an alias for each SVG element, e.g., `circle`, _etc_, and parse their documentation from `MDN`.
- [ ] Update `documentary` to make sure that types are linked to their description.
- [ ] Update `alamode` to be able to write XML syntax (JSX transform).
- [ ] Update `minify` to work correctly with attributes on new lines.

## Copyright

Some of the element documentation, including `rect` was taken directly from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/).
