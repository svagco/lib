## TODO

- [ ] Create an alias for each SVG element, e.g., `circle`, _etc_.
- [ ] Update `documentary` to make sure that types are linked to their description.

## Copyright

Some of the element documentation, including `rect` was taken directly from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/).
